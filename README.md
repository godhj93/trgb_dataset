## Rapid and Safe Human Detection in Uninhabited Terrains Integrating Formation Flight and Multispectral Imaging

This repository contains the dataset used in the paper "Rapid and Safe Human Detection in Uninhabited Terrains Integrating Formation Flight and Multispectral Imaging" which is being reviewed for publication in International Journal of Control, Automation and Systems.

The dataset is captured by aerial robots to train and test human detection algorithms. The dataset is captured in a mountainous terrain and wild forest. The dataset consists of multispectral images (RGB and thermal) and the corresponding ground truth annotations.
